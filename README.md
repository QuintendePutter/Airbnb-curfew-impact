# The impact of Corona curfews on the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam

This repository belongs to the research into The impact of Corona curfews on the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam. The research is part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com) course at Tilburg University. In this research we answer the following research question:

**To what extent did the Covid-19 curfew influence the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam, and to what extent was this relationship by the neighbourhood and the host status?**

## Motivation

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on our society for more than one and a half years now. In order to reduce the spread of the virus, an intelligent lockdown was introduced; face masks were made mandatory in public areas and we also had to deal with a very drastic measure: the curfew. In the Netherlands, from January 23rd to April 28th, it was mandatory to stay indoors between 21:00 and 04:30 (from the 31st of March the curfew was delayed to 22:00). The curfew was not mandatory for people that had crucial professions such as in the healthcare, supermarkets and similar industries. Nevertheless, the curfew did have a major impact on the society. Amsterdam is, for example, a city that is heavily reliable on tourism. According to [Statistic Netherlands (CBS)](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/aanvullende-statistische-diensten/2021/toerismerekeningen-gemeente-amsterdam-2017-2019-?onepage=true), approximately 9% of the Amsterdam economy comes from tourism. Therefore, we think it would be interesting to find out what influence the curfew has had on the rental prices of the apartments in Amsterdam on the Airbnb platform. Airbnb experienced a significant loss due to the pandemic. In the first nine months of 2020, Airbnb already [lost almost 700 million dollar](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-coronavirus-impact/)(more than the total loss of 2019) mainly due the effects of the corona virus. Also, in 2020 the revenue was down 32% compared to 2019. The outcome of the research can be interesting for, for example, the income of the landlords. Since this concerns people's income, it can be determined whether landlords had more or less to spend during the curfew. In addition, we want to explore the impact on other factors, such as:
- The neighbourhood of the Airbnb listing
- The host status, whether they are a superhost or not
