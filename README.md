## Motivation

Covid 19 has had a major impact on our society for over a year now. An intelligent lockdown was introduced, face masks were made mandatory in public areas and we also had to deal with a very drastic measure: the curfew. In the Netherlands, from January 23 to April 28, it was mandatory to stay indoors between 21:00 and 04:30 (from 31, but this was delayed to 22:00). Such a drastic measure has a major impact on society. We think it would be interesting to find out what influence the curfew has had on the rental prices of the apartments in Amsterdam on the Airbnb platform. The outcome of the research can be interesting for, for example, the income of the landlords. Since this concerns people's income, it can be determined whether landlords had more or less to spend during the curfew.
