# The impact of Corona curfews on the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam

This repository belongs to the research into the impact of Corona curfews on the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam. The research is part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com) course at Tilburg University. In this research we answer the following research question:

**Did the curfew affect prices of Airbnb listings? Zooming in on Amsterdam**



## Motivation

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on our society for more than eighteen months now. To reduce the spread of the virus, an intelligent lockdown was introduced in the Netherlands. Face masks were made mandatory in public areas and people had to deal with a very drastic measure: the curfew. In the Netherlands, from January 23rd to April 28th, it was made mandatory to stay indoors between 21:00 and 04:30 (from 31st of March the curfew times changed to 22:00 till 04:30). 

The curfew and other covid restrictions had a massive impact on society, especially tourism:
- Airbnb lost [almost 700 million dollars](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-coronavirus-impact/) in the first nine months of 2020, more than the total loss of 2019.
- Airbnb's revenue was 32% lower in 2020 than it was in 2019. 

For this research project we zoom in on Amsterdam. A city that heavily reliant on tourism [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/aanvullende-statistische-diensten/2021/toerismerekeningen-gemeente-amsterdam-2017-2019-?onepage=true).

**Why is this research interesting and important?**
- Determining the effect of the curfew on the income of landlords.
- Effects of the neighbourhood on the Airbnb listing.
- Effects of the host status on the Airbnb listing.
